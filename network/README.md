**Design principles**

- Value stream oriented
- Individual value stream projects can be configured with individual tooling, services and applications
- Value streams, whilst retaining individual application, development and release lifecycles, plug into the existing shared management and administration framework
- Value streams can inter-communicate and share resources
- Centralised egress design pattern
- Firewall rules and VPC Service Controls per value stream
